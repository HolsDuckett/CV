## About Me
I am a problem solver who loves a good challenge (you should see my codewords book) and am able to take ownership of an issue through to resolution.

As an operations manager for one of the largest and leading event venues in london, I achieved solving the unsolvable for clients such as Moncler, Bacardi and Netflix, on a daily basis. I thought I had mastered the creative art of problem solving, that was until I was introduced to coding. 

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy I am noW looking for the opportunity to expand my skills into the tech world as a Software Devloper.

## Skills

- events about preventative planning but also very high pressure on the day as there is an immeditae time pressure due to the event being live with paying customers. I am the one responsible for any problems and have to direct or fix as quick as possible. This require creative and proactive problem solving.
