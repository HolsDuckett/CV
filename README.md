## About Me

Working for one of the largest and leading event venues in London, I achieved solving the unsolvable for clients such as Moncler, Bacardi and Netflix, on a daily basis. It was trying to solve one of these problems that I was first drawn to Software Development. I wanted to write a program that was specific to our venue space which would consequently make our team more efficient and effective. The moment I started programming I fell in love with the continuous feedback, reflection and improvement cycle it allowed. From then onwards this was my passion and the way I wanted to work in the future.

I enjoy working in challenging environments and developing or learning from others. For this reason I have chosen a career in software development with its continuous problems and infinite depth of learning.

## Skills

### Organisation and Time Management

My **excellent time management and organisation ensured the successful smooth running of all the events I managed**. A detailed plan including specific tasks and strict deadlines created an essential overview allowing me to **manage all projects effectively**. During Makers, I have continuously applied this skill set when approaching our Team Projects; **creating sprints with planned purposeful tasks and strict deadlines** allowed us to be **efficient, productive** and thus create numerous successful and informative projects.

### Detail Orientated

My ability to **quickly spot crucial missing information** in Risk Assessments resulted in all my clients not only having a smooth event but one that was safe and adhered to all outside regulations. **Reading hundreds of Risk Assessments and writing security briefs has sharpened my skills** over the years. When writing code in pairing sessions and group projects I am often quick to spot when a comma has been missed, a method has been spelt incorrectly or an ‘end’ is in the wrong place **saving unnecessary frustration** down the line.

### Communication

Through both my use of **communication skills and clearly structured communication processes** I was able to **build a proactive and focused team**. Clearly communicating my expectations of them and **ensuring I was available to listen and respond** to their training requirements as well as other ideas for completing the job to the best of their abilities was a **key skill in the success of our services as a company**. As a result of this, **within 3 months of becoming responsible for managing all event service teams, we had a 100% recurring booking record**.


### Quick Learner

Learning new technologies is a key skill of mine, which can be demonstrated through my success at Makers Academy thus far. Due to my **inquisitive nature and my speedy knowledge on-boarding**, I was able to create a mock web page in my spare time using **self taught** basics of javascript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap for my personal web development interest prior to joining Makers. Since joining Makers, **I have created a vast collection of projects that delve into the different technologies and architectures used in web development**. From single page javascript apps, to intricate rails projects, I've **successfully explored a great range of innovative tech** that's leading the companies of today to greatness.
